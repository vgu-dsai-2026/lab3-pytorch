# Repository Structure

You should only edit **two files** in this repository: `basic_notebook.ipynb` and `notebook.ipynb`. The `basic_notebook.ipynb` file is for introducing and practicing the functions, while **`notebook.ipynb`** is the **MAIN WORKING** notebook where you complete your answers and submit your work for grading. **DO NOT** modify any other files in the repository. All other files must remain unchanged and should be treated as read-only. Any changes outside these two notebooks may cause issues with testing, grading, or repository integrity.

## Working with the repository

### Use GitHub Codespaces

Follow the steps below to set up your development environment for this lab.

#### 1. Install `uv`

First, install the `uv` package manager:

```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

> *Note: For Windows, follow the instructions on the [uv installation page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)*

#### 2. Create and Sync the Virtual Environment

```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically create a virtual environment (.venv) and install all required dependencies.

#### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the environment before running any lab code:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Use the Python interpreter inside this virtual environment for all your work.

### Working locally (Linux/MacOS)

#### 1. Clone your repository to your local machine

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```

#### 2. Install package manager `uv`

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    > *Note: For Windows, follow the instructions on the [uv installation page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)*

#### 3. Set up virtual env

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

#### 4. Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    > *In Windows, you can activate the virtual environment with:*

    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate # for Command Prompt
    # or
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # for PowerShell
    ```

## Submitting your work

1. Add your changes

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2. Commit your changes with a message

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
    ```

3. Push your changes to GitHub

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

> *Note: Make sure to push your changes to the `main` branch of your repository.*
